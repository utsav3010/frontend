Q.2  What are the disadvantages of CSS? 

Ans:- 
      1. There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.

      2. With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.

      3. After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.

      4. As CSS specifications evolve, some features may not be supported in older browsers, requiring developers to use alternative methods or provide fallbacks.
