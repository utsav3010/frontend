Q.11  How to center block elements using CSS1?

Ans:- 

1. Auto Margins: 
You can use auto margins to center a block-level element horizontally within its containing element. This technique relies on setting the left and right margins to 'auto'.

Syntax:- 
         width: 50%;
         margin-left: auto;
         margin-right: auto;

2. Text Alignment:
If the block element contains inline content, you can use the text-align property on the parent to center it horizontally.
This works if the block contains inline content, but it won't work as well if the content is block-level.

Syntax:- 
        text-align: center;
        
        display: inline; /* or inline-block */
