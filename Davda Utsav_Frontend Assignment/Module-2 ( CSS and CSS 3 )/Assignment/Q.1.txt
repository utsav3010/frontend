                                     Module 4 - CSS and CSS 3

Q.1  What are the benefits of using CSS?

Ans:-  
      1. CSS allows web developers to separate the structure and design of a web page. This separation makes it easier to maintain and update websites, as changes to the design can be made without altering the content.

      2. Easy for the user to customize the online page.

      3. CSS is essential for creating responsive web designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS can be used to change the layout and styling of a page based on the screen size.

      4. With external CSS files, you can style multiple web pages with the same design, ensuring a uniform appearance across the entire website.
