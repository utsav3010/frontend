Q.7  How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

Ans:- 
     The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

Syntax:-
         background-repeat: background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;
    
Ex.  
    body {
    background-image: url('background.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat; 
    background-size: cover; /* This ensures the image covers the entire background */
}

--> repeat: The background image will repeat both horizontally and vertically.
--> repeat-x: The background image will repeat only horizontally.
--> repeat-y: The background image will repeat only vertically.
--> no-repeat: This prevents the image from repeating
