Q.8  What is === operator?

Ans:- 
     --> The === operator is a strict equality operator used in some programming languages, including JavaScript. It is also referred to as the "strict equality" or "identity" operator. The purpose of === is to compare both the value and the data type of two operands.

     --> In JavaScript, for example:

     == (loose equality) compares the values for equality after performing type coercion if needed.
     === (strict equality) compares the values and the types without performing type coercion.

     --> Example:

     let x = 5;
     let y = "5";

     console.log(x == y);  // true (loose equality, value is the same after coercion)
     console.log(x === y); // false (strict equality, value is the same, but types are different)
