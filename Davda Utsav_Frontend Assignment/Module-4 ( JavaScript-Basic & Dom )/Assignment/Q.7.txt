Q.7  What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

Ans:-
     --> 1.Scope: 

     ViewState: ViewState is used to persist state information of a single page across postbacks. It stores data on the client side, typically in a hidden field, and is sent back and forth between the server and the client with each request and response.

     SessionState: SessionState is used to persist data across multiple pages in a user session. It stores data on the server side, and the data is associated with a particular user's session. SessionState allows you to store and retrieve data for the duration of a user's interaction with the application.

     --> 2.Storage Location:

     ViewState: Stored on the client side, usually in a hidden field within the HTML output of the page.

     SessionState: Stored on the server side, either in-process within the ASP.NET process, in an external state server, or in a database.

     --> 3. Performance:

     ViewState: Can increase the size of the page, leading to increased bandwidth usage and slower page loads, especially when large amounts of data are stored.

     SessionState: Generally has less impact on page size, but storing large amounts of data in the session can impact server memory and performance.

     --> 4. Security:

     ViewState: Because it's stored on the client side, it can potentially be tampered with by users. ASP.NET provides mechanisms to ensure data integrity, such as ViewState MAC (Message Authentication Code).

     SessionState: Stored on the server side, making it more secure compared to ViewState. However, the security of SessionState depends on proper session management and protection against session hijacking.
