Q.5  What are undeclared and undefined variables?

Ans:- 
      1.Undeclared Variables:

      --> An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in code without being formally declared (defined) using a declaration statement such as var, let, or const (depending on the programming language).
      --> If you try to use a variable without declaring it first, the interpreter or compiler may raise an error. Undeclared variables can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior in a program.

      Example:
      // Undeclared variable
      console.log(x);  // Error: x is not defined

      2.Undefined Variables:

      --> An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. In many programming languages, when a variable is declared but not initialized, its default value is often undefined.
      --> It's important to distinguish between undeclared and undefined variables. An undeclared variable hasn't been declared at all, while an undefined variable has been declared but doesn't currently have a value assigned to it.

      Example:
      // Declared but undefined variable
      var y;
      console.log(y);  // undefined
