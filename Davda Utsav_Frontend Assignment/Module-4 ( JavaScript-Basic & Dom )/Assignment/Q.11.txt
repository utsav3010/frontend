Q.11  What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

Ans:-
     --> JavaScript provides several looping structures to iterate over data or execute a block of code repeatedly. Here are the main looping structures in JavaScript:

     --> 1. for Loop: The for loop is a common and versatile loop that allows you to specify initialization, condition, and iteration expressions in a single line.

     -> Syntax: for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
     // code to be executed
     }
     -> Example: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     console.log(i);
     }

     --> 2. while Loop: The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.

     -> Syntax: while (condition) {
     // code to be executed
     }
     -> Example: let i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
     console.log(i);
     i++;
     }

     3. do...while Loop: Similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the block of code is executed, ensuring that the code inside the loop is executed at least once.

     -> Syntax: do {
     // code to be executed
     } while (condition);
     -> Example: let i = 0;
     do {
     console.log(i);
     i++;
     } while (i < 5);

     4. for...in Loop: Used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It is generally used with objects, and the loop variable represents the property name.

     -> Syntax: for (variable in object) {
     // code to be executed
     }
     -> Example: const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
     for (let key in obj) {
     console.log(key, obj[key]);
     }

     5. for...of Loop: Introduced in ECMAScript 6, this loop is used to iterate over iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.). It provides a simpler syntax compared to for...in and directly accesses the values, not the keys.

     -> Syntax: for (variable of iterable) {
     // code to be executed
     }
     -> Example: const array = [1, 2, 3];
     for (let value of array) {
     console.log(value);
     }
