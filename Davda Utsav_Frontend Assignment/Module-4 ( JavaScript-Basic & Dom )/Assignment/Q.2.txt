Q.2  What is the use of isNaN function?

Ans:-  
      --> The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. NaN is a special value in JavaScript that represents the result of an operation that cannot produce a meaningful numeric result. 

     --> For example, dividing zero by zero or attempting to convert a non-numeric string to a number can result in NaN.
